Scraping of recommended books to read
1. I plan on making a program that scrapes data from 'GoodReads' and spits out a list of recommended books. I do plan on attempting to make it so the code is able to call specific genres and authors if desired by the user.
   I might not be understanding what section 2 is asking but, i guess these would be the
2 a, Attempt to gather data from host website
  b, Parse the code, so that it reads it from html and extracts data into script
  c. Turns it into "tables" in order for user to read the recommendations breakdown, essentially making it into a readable list.
3. Null
4. Null
