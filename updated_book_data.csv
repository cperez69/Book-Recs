The 272,By Rachel L. Swarns,"Seven years ago, journalist, author, and professor Rachel L. Swarns started a national conversation with her writing by exposing Georgetown University’s ties to slavery. In 1838, 272 enslaved people were sold by a group of American priests to save the country’s first Roman Catholic institution of higher learning—what is now Georgetown University—from financial ruin. But this decision would do more than save the college. “Without the enslaved, the Catholic Church in the United States as we know it today would not exist,” Swarns argues in The 272, her doggedly researched account of that shameful event. Swarns’ third book illustrates how the Church benefited from slave labor by following the Mahoneys, one of the enslaved families who suffered as a result of those sins. She begins with their matriarch, Ann Joice, who sailed to Maryland in the late 1600s as a free woman only to be enslaved by the Jesuit priests. The author then shows how that miscarriage of justice led to Joice’s descendents being put up for sale a century and a half later. The 272 is an unflinching condemnation of the Catholic Church’s past and a long overdue eulogy for those who are long gone but should never be forgotten. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: The 272 on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The272.jpg?quality=85&w=800,History
A Day in the Life of Abed Salama,by Nathan Thrall,"For most of the century that Palestinians and Israelis have fought over the same land, the conflict has not been nearly as visible as the 2023 war in the Gaza Strip, or the murder of Israeli civilians by Hamas that it answered. Since 1967, when Israel won military control of every disputed acre, the conflict has typically ground along at the level of everyday existence. That’s somehow easier to imagine for the 2 million Palestinians isolated in the fenced enclave of Gaza. But another 3 million Palestinians reside on the West Bank, where Israeli troops enforce an “administrative” control that’s intended to avoid drama. It was there, in 2012, that a fiery school bus accident killed kindergarteners on the outskirts of Jerusalem. In A Day in the Life of Abed Salama, Nathan Thrall not only recounts a father’s frantic search for his 5-year-old son after the crash; his deeply reported book also places the reader in the realm Palestinians navigate every day, a lesser world in which life and death may be decided by others. —Karl Vick Buy Now: A Day in the Life of Abed Salama on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ADayInTheLifeOfAbed.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography
A Living Remedy,by Nicole Chung,"In her poem “For Three Days,” Marie Howe writes that “even grief provides a living remedy,” that mourning can be a way to keep those we love alive. Nicole Chung took those words to heart when writing the follow-up to her poignant 2018 debut memoir, All You Can Ever Know, which detailed her experience as a Korean American adoptee of a white family. A Living Remedy is an elegy for her adopted parents, who died within two years of one another. First, Chung lost her father in early 2018, before the release of her first book, to late-stage kidney failure made worse by the diabetes he was unable to properly treat due to financial reasons. (“It is still hard for me not to think of my father’s death as a kind of negligent homicide,” Chung writes, “facilitated and sped by the state’s failure to fulfill its most basic responsibilities to him and others like him.”) Then, in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, while writing this book, she lost her mother to cancer. In lyrical prose, Chung, a TIME contributor, describes what it was like before her mother’s death, and the distance, both physical and emotional, that developed between them. In the end, her latest book is a brutally intimate portrait of the guilt and grief that comes with losing a parent. It’s also a searing indictment of a broken health care system from someone who saw firsthand how it exploits patients and their families. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: A Living Remedy on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ALivingRemedy.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography
Above Ground,By Clint Smith,"The award-winning poet and journalist Clint Smith tackles the joys and tribulations of parenthood in his latest poetry collection, Above Ground. Written over the course of six years in which he welcomed two children, Smith’s collection attempts to view the world with the same wide-eyed wonder that his son and daughter do. It’s hard not to be tickled by his descriptions of his kids picking a flower for the first time, watching a ladybug fly across the room, or throwing a spontaneous dance party in the kitchen. But Smith knows that parenting is not always answering questions about jellyfish and giraffes, two animals that inspire some of the sweetest and most enlightening poems in the book. With wisdom and empathy, he tries to unpack the ways in which the world can be cruel and unforgiving, especially toward Black people. In “National Anthem,” a woman’s furious reaction to Colin Kaepernick kneeling becomes a sobering reminder of the prejudice his little boy will face as he gets older. In the anthology’s titular poem, Smith spots the golden exoskeleton of a cicada, which emerges from the ground after 17 years, and he wonders if climate change will keep them from returning in another 17. Yet, like so many poems in this moving follow up to his 2021 nonfiction book How the Word Is Passed, Smith finds faith in the unknowable and hope in a world that is ever changing. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Above Ground on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AboveGround.jpg?quality=85&w=2400,History
Absolution,By Alice McDermott,"With her ninth novel, National Book Award winner Alice McDermott attempts to understand the role that the wives of American soldiers played in the Vietnam War. The book begins in 1963 Saigon, with Tricia, a shy newlywed, whose lawyer husband is working for Navy intelligence as a “civilian advisor.” She soon finds herself forming an unlikely alliance with Charlene, a seasoned military wife and mother of three, who shows her how to support her husband without being subservient. Tricia struggles to find her own purpose until she and Charlene begin “helping” the people of Vietnam. It’s not until 60 years later, when Tricia is contacted by someone from her past, that she begins to question her own culpability in the conflict. Absolution is a moving story about the obligation, sacrifice, and regret that comes with living on the periphery of history. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Absolution on Bookshop | Amazon Looking for more book recommendations?

After Sappho,by Selby Wynn Schwartz,"An experiment in form, After Sappho is told in the collective voice and uses the pronoun “we” to knit together biographical anecdotes from the lives of many historical women, including Virginia Woolf, Gertrude Stein, and Italian writer Lina Poletti. The book takes a cue from the ancient Greek poet Sappho’s own writing, largely left to us in fragmented form, and its themes of desire and belonging. In one moment, a glass mirror shatters and yet “we” can still admire ourselves in the fragments. Though heavily researched, the work blends fiction and nonfiction into a chatty whole. The cumulative effect is a loose history of feminist fire-starters and lesbian icons coming into their own in the modern era. —Eliana Dockterman Buy Now: After Sappho on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AfterSappho.jpg?quality=85&w=800,History
After the Funeral,by Tessa Hadley,"Tessa Hadley’s short story collection After the Funeral and Other Stories is about those moments of happenstance that change the trajectory of a life. Across 12 stories, the best-selling British author writes shrewd but compassionate profiles of characters, mostly women, who are at odds with their families, their partners, and even themselves. It’s through coincidence—a literal run-in with an ex-husband, a missed connection with an estranged sister, an unexpected dinner guest—that these unassuming characters are given a chance to reflect on who they have become and who they’d like to be. In “Funny Little Snake,” 24-year-old Valerie finds herself caring for her older husband’s 9-year-old daughter. After forming an unlikely bond with the child, who has long been neglected by her parents, Valerie makes a questionable decision that she hopes will put them both on exciting new paths. Like much of Hadley’s sharp-witted collection, this tale ends ambiguously. Just as it appears our protagonist is on the brink of a breakthrough, we are left to wonder if people really can change. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: After the Funeral on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AfterTheFuneral.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography
All Souls,By Saskia Hamilton,"Saskia Hamilton’s latest poetry collection, All Souls, was written before her death from cancer earlier this year at the age of 56. Broken into four lyrical sequences, her final anthology is a meditation on death and dying that reflects on the totality of her life. In the sharply written opening poem, “Faring,” she plays with that word’s double meaning—to travel and to proceed—as if daring readers to continue with her on this existential journey to reclaim the memories of her past before it is too late. Chronology is not important to Hamilton when telling her story. Instead, she tracks her time on earth through free association. In “Museum Going,” she recalls a childhood trip to a museum in Holland, where her mom grew up, which leads her to think about her family’s ties to World War II. In the titular poem, she wonders if her young son’s obsession with video games that recreate the horrors of war will help him cope when she is gone. She has found her own coping mechanism in language. By writing all this down, she is able to accept the inevitability of time. All Souls is a devastating reminder of one’s own mortality, written by a writer who has gone too soon. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: All Souls on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AllSouls.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography
All the Sinners Bleed,by S.A. Cosby,"The fourth novel by acclaimed crime writer S.A. Cosby opens with a pair of all-too-familiar tragedies: a school shooting and the subsequent death of a young Black man at the hands of local cops. But from there, this Southern gothic thriller heads in an entirely unexpected direction, as the initial burst of violence gives way to an investigation into a masked cabal caught on video torturing and killing Black teenagers. It’s a grim premise, but Cosby filters it through the humanizing perspective of the first Black sheriff in the small Virginia town where the murders take place—a brave, smart, and tenacious hero with regrets in his past, a big question mark in his future, and a burning need for redemption in the present. All the Sinners Bleed is the rare detective story that’s well aware of how racist policing muddies the morality of cop protagonists, and is a book that will leave you breathlessly turning pages until its final showdown. —Judy Berman Buy Now: All the Sinners Bleed on Bookshop | Amazon Looking for more book recommendations?

Anansi's Gold,by Yepoka Yeebo,"Journalist Yepoka Yeebo’s Anansi’s Gold: The Man Who Looted the West, Outfoxed Washington, and Swindled the World tells the story of how audacious Ghanaian con man John Ackah Blay-Miezah pulled off one of the longest-running scams of the 20th century. In the 1970s and ’80s, Blay-Miezah managed to swindle politicians, high-class businessmen, and heads of state with a scam predicated on a tall tale. In 1972, on his deathbed, Ghana’s first President, Kwame Nkrumah, revealed that he had millions of dollars stowed away in Swiss bank vaults. Blay-Miezah sold himself as a close confidante of the late leader and, over the span of 15 years, conned at least 300 people into investing millions into his efforts to secure the fake funds. In return, he promised they’d be handsomely rewarded. Through meticulous and shrewd reporting, Yeebo breaks down the many reasons why Blay-Miezah’s claims were too enticing for even the most sophisticated marks to ignore. For one, with his tailored suits and Rolls Royce, he looked the part of a wealthy benefactor who could hobnob with the elite. Yeebo describes in great detail the lengths to which the con man went to keep his high-yield racket going in a pre-internet world. But the author also points out another more sinister reason for Blay-Miezah’s success: the wealthiest were more than willing to pilfer from a recently decolonized Africa with very few questions asked. Anansi’s Gold is an enthralling rags-to-stolen-riches story, a thrilling true-crime caper, and a sharp indictment of a world that allows scammers like Blay-Miezah to thrive. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Anansi’s Gold on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AnansisGold.jpg?quality=85&w=800,History

Anderson, a 30-something British virtuoso whose piano performance in Vienna comes to a surprising halt when she walks off the stage and into chaos of her own creation. Elsa becomes fixated on a stranger who looks exactly like her—and she starts seeing the mysterious woman all over Europe. In detailing her protagonist’s journey, Levy crafts a surreal and moving narrative about identity and art.

The Bee Sting,By Paul Murray,"Dickie Barnes isn’t doing well. Ever since the 2008 financial crisis, the once-wealthy car salesman has been in crisis mode. The economic downturn is one thing, and the growing effects of climate change are another. He has drained his family’s savings and is building a bunker in the woods to prepare for the apocalypse. Anxiety pervades the household: Dickie’s wife is selling off her possessions to make ends meet, his daughter is drinking her way through high school to cope, and his son is texting a stranger about video games just to feel seen. Irish novelist Paul Murray’s latest is a tragicomedy in the vein of his 2010 best seller Skippy Dies. Balancing humor with devastation, he creates a portrait of a fractured family attempting to survive their personal struggles amid what increasingly feels like the end of the world. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: The Bee Sting on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TheBeeSting.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Fiction
Big Swiss,by Jen Beagin,"Set in the boho-chic town of Hudson, N.Y., Jen Beagin’s laughter-inducing Big Swiss centers on a sex therapist’s transcriptionist, a 45-year-old California transplant named Greta. The novel follows the adrift Greta as she begins to fantasize about a 28-year-old patient who she lovingly names Big Swiss—ostensibly because she’s from Switzerland and, well, she’s tall. As Greta works her way through transcribing Big Swiss’s sessions with the therapist, she learns that her crush, whose real name is Flavia, was brutally assaulted years ago and the attacker has recently been released from prison. Also, Flavia has never had an orgasm. Enamored with the idea of the woman on the tapes, Greta finally meets her in a dog park, and a torrid affair ensues. Sexy and darkly funny, at its core this novel turns preconceived notions about mental health, obsession, and trauma upside down. —Rachel Sonis Buy Now: Big Swiss on Bookshop | Amazon Looking for more book recommendations?

Biography of X,By Catherine Lacey,"Catherine Lacey’s Biography of X is a daring reimagining of 20th century America where the Vietnam War never happened, Bernie Sanders was President, and an enigmatic multi-hyphenate artist named X was worthy of two biographies. The novel opens in 1997, one year after X dies, just as a book about her is released. X’s widow, an alt-weekly journalist named C.M. Lucca, is unnerved by the biography’s publication—it’s not factually accurate—so she takes matters into her own hands. C.M. sets out to write the definitive book on X’s life, much of which, she learns, she was not privy to. Lacey casts X as a Zelig-like figure who loosely resembles the real iconoclasts of the downtown New York art scene of the ’70s (Patti Smith, Nan Goldin, Susan Sontag, to name a few) and worked with some of the biggest names from that era (David Bowie, Tom Waits, Annie Leibovitz). Lacey seamlessly blurs the line between fact and fiction, including frequent footnotes that cite real articles and fake ones by real journalists. The result is a kaleidoscopic exploration of art, love, and grief. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Biography of X on Bookshop | Amazon Looking for more book recommendations?

Birnam Wood,by Eleanor Catton,"In Eleanor Catton’s third novel, Mira Bunting leads a group of guerilla gardeners who operate under the name Birnam Wood. The ragtag collective pushes back against climate change and capitalism by planting gardens, both legally and illegally, across New Zealand. When American billionaire Robert Lemoine offers to bankroll the group, Mira accepts the money without hesitation. But the tech mogul turns out to be more sinister than expected, and his funding becomes a major point of contention among the do-gooders. Told through rotating points of view, Birnam Wood is a thrilling surveillance satire that explores idealism and ideology, morality and motive—and questions what it means to be truly good in the era of late-stage capitalism. —Meg Zukin Buy Now: Birnam Wood on Bookshop | Amazon Looking for more book recommendations?

Blackouts,by Justin Torres,"Based on the real-life work of queer researcher and activist Jan Gay, Justin Torres’ new novel is a transfixing and emotional examination of history. Blackouts follows a dying elderly man, Juan Gay, and his nameless, 20-something caretaker to explore what it means to be erased. Throughout, Torres draws on photographs, illustrations, and redacted passages from “Sex Variants: A Study in Homosexual Patterns,” a 1941 committee report whose authorship is attributed to psychiatrist George W. Henry but that originated as a compilation of queer stories collected by Jan. In doing so, Blackouts, a finalist for the 2023 National Book Award in fiction, illuminates the ways in which the lives and experiences of marginalized people have long been omitted from written records. —Megan McCluskey Buy Now: Blackouts on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Blackout.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography
Chrome Valley,By Mahogany L. Browne,"Exploring girlhood to motherhood, Mahogany L. Browne’s poetry collection, Chrome Valley, offers an intimate portrait of what it means to be a Black woman in America. Using her own coming of age in Oakland, Calif., as inspiration, the YA author and poet looks at the pleasure and pain that comes with being a teenage girl: “You ain’t had freedom / ’til you climb on a bus 62 / & head to the closest mall / for a girl fight.” She often transitions from writing about the simple joys to tackling the larger battle being waged against her community. “I think ‘God! Is this the fight?/ To be Black and beautiful and breathing.’” Death is omnipresent in this collection because, as Browne explains in its opening pages, “When you are a black writer in America:/it gets harder to ignore the bodies.” Throughout Chrome Valley, she grapples with generational trauma while paying tribute to a long history of resistance. She delves into the anxieties that come with being a mother to a Black child by evoking the names of women—Mamie Till, Kadiatou Diallo, Sybrina Fulton—who have lost their sons to police violence. With great compassion and fury, Browne shows how survival has become an act of defiance. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Chrome Valley on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ChromeValley.jpg?quality=85&w=800,History
The Covenant of Water,By Abraham Verghese,"After 14 years, physician Abraham Verghese returns with the follow-up to his 2009 best-selling fiction debut Cutting For Stone. The Covenant of Water follows three generations of an unlucky South Indian family. The Parambils, led by matriarch Big Ammachi, suffer the same tragedy in each generation: at least one person dies by drowning. The over 700-page novel set in Kerala, a southwestern Indian state surrounded by water, between the years of 1900 and 1977, is an evocative work of epic proportions. It is both historical fiction that offers a voyeuristic view into India’s history and a detailed accounting of the medical advancements of the 20th century. Most notably, The Covenant of Water is a religious fable in which Verghese attempts to answer the age-old question: Why do bad things happen to good people? —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Covenant of Water on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TheCovenantOfWater.jpg?quality=85&w=800,History
Crook Manifesto,by Colson Whitehead,"In the sequel to his 2021 best seller Harlem Shuffle, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Colson Whitehead revisits the world of Ray Carney, a full-time furniture salesman and part-time criminal. Crook Manifesto picks up in 1971, when Ray’s attempt to stick to his store—and to stay away from all that crime he got caught up in before—is disrupted by his daughter’s desperate plea to see the Jackson 5 live. Ray decides he’ll do whatever it takes to make his kid happy, even if the risks he has to take to obtain the money for tickets turn deadly. Through brilliantly constructed twists and turns, set in a vibrantly detailed 1970s New York City, Whitehead once again demonstrates his prowess as an author whose work can stand out in any genre. His latest crime novel is simultaneously sharp, funny, and full of heart—and an elegant portrait of Harlem and its residents. —Annabel Gutterman Buy Now: Crook Manifesto on Bookshop | Amazon Looking for more book recommendations?

While her specialty is providing historical context to current events, she is also not afraid to get personal. In the powerful titular essay, she writes about having a miscarriage and a late best friend who was by her side.

Desertion,by Abdulrazak Gurnah,"Abdulrazak Gurnah’s previously out-of-print 2005 novel, published in the U.S. for the first time this year, begins with a half-starving Englishman named Martin Pearce. It’s 1899 and Martin finds himself in a coastal East African village where he meets and falls in love with Rehana, the sister of the local shopkeeper who nurses him back to health. The couple’s illicit love story plays out across the book’s early chapters with Gurnah using flashbacks to show just how symbiotic the two are despite their disparate backgrounds. One may begin to write off Desertion as a star-crossed epic romance, until Gurnah pulls off an unexpectedly heartbreaking twist. The book then jumps ahead to the 1950s, where a new narrator and cast of characters is introduced. When their connection to Martin and Rehana is eventually uncovered, Gurnah, winner of the 2021 Nobel Prize in Literature, reveals just how small the world really is. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Desertion on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Desertion.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Fiction
Doppelganger,by Naomi Klein,"In Doppelganger: A Trip Into the Mirror World, noted leftist and activist Naomi Klein introduces readers to “Other Naomi,” which is how she has come to think of Naomi Wolf, her right-wing, fun-house-mirror double who she can’t seem to escape. After experiencing one too many in-person and online mixups between herself and Wolf, Klein wonders how Other Naomi, once a Rhodes Scholar and feminist media darling, transformed into a prominent voice in the alt-right, anti-vax landscape, becoming a fixture on Steve Bannon’s podcast and a proud member of the so-called War Room posse. She tumbles down the rabbit hole of “disaster doppelgangers” and “digital doubles,” turning to Hitchock and bell hooks and Freud, among others, in order to make sense of her situation. Klein’s writing is urgent as she dissects conspiracy theories hawked by wellness influencers, unpacks the influence of Nazis on autism research, and more—all while acknowledging the absurdity of her situation. She weaves cultural criticism with personal anecdotes and self-examination into a book that’s bold enough to propose that we will all someday emerge from the rubble of the crumbling world—it will just take reimagining, collective organizing, and ego annihilating. —Meg Zukin Buy Now: Doppelganger on Bookshop | Amazon Looking for more book recommendations?

She describes how she received a bipolar II diagnosis as an adult, and started taking medication for the first time. And she uses her childhood diagnosis of dyscalculia, a kind of math dyslexia, to better understand the miscalculations she has made in her love life. Her prose is lyrical, shattered, and visceral.

Fair Play,By Katie Barnes,"What does a fair and trans-inclusive athletic policy look like? That is the question at the heart of journalist Katie Barnes’ electrifying debut, Fair Play: How Sports Shape the Gender Debates, which looks at the role gender has historically played in sports. Through in-depth and compassionate reporting, Barnes breaks down the misunderstood science surrounding sex and gender that has been used to keep cisgender women out of sports and has fueled debate over trans athletes participation in women’s sports. As Barnes explains, those who support trans sports bans have claimed that it would be unfair for trans women to compete against those who were assigned female at birth. Barnes investigates the validity of those concerns by speaking with medical experts and analyzing the difference between using testosterone to medically transition and using it to gain competitive advantage. The writer also takes a closer look at Title IX, the landmark 1972 federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in education, and how it unnecessarily normalized sex segregation in sports. But Barnes, who identifies as nonbinary, knows this issue is not just a political or scientific one. They put the personal stories of trans and nonbinary athletes at the center of the discussion, interviewing South African Olympic middle-distance runner Caster Semenya and University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas to understand the real effects these reactive laws are having on the community. Despite a rise in anti-trans bills in the U.S. over the past year, Barnes ends Fair Play on a hopeful note, offering their own thoughtful policy recommendations and suggestions to make athletics more inclusive. If there is anything Barnes has learned, it’s that there’s always a path forward—even if the road is a long one. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Fair Play on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FairPlay.jpg?quality=85&w=800,History

Fire Weather,by John Vaillant,"With Fire Weather: A True Story from a Hotter World, journalist John Vaillant offers a vivid retelling of the multi-billion-dollar disaster that he calls “the wildfire equivalent of Hurricane Katrina.” In May 2016, Fort McMurray, a small Canadian city at the center of the country’s oil industry, was destroyed by a colossal wildfire that drove 88,000 people from their homes. To better understand how this apocalyptic natural disaster happened, the award-winning author of The Golden Spruce and The Tiger chronicles the intertwining histories of North America’s oil and gas industries and the study of climate change. Using images from cell phone cameras, security cameras, and a nanny cam placed in a child’s stuffed animal, Vaillant offers a gripping depiction of the blaze’s devastating trajectory. While he offers firsthand accounts from residents affected by the inferno, the book’s true protagonist is fire, which Vaillant treats like a living, breathing creature that is destined to grow even more dangerous as the world becomes even more combustible. At a time when wildfires are dominating news cycles, Fire Weather is not just a timely and stunning account of recent history—it’s also a frightening preview of what could become our new normal. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Fire Weather on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FireWeather.jpg?quality=85&w=800,History
From From,By Monica Youn,"American racism is at the forefront of Monica Youn’s daring and inventive new poetry collection, From From. The book’s title is a reference to the accusatory question Americans of color are confronted with all too often: “Yes, but where are you from from?” Blending confessional personal essays and adventurous poetic forms, Youn describes the microaggressions she faced as a Korean American kid growing up in Houston and the larger effects they’ve had on her self-esteem. The heartbreaking “Epicanthic” recalls the schoolyard bullying an Asian American girl faces for her appearance. In “Deracinations: Eight Sonigrams,” she interrogates the language that is used to talk about race and to define Asianness, ruminating on casual racist remarks that evoke white supremacy. Dr. Seuss becomes a surprising central figure at one point, with her writing of the imaginary daughter, Chrysanthemum-Pearl, he invented while authoring anti-Japanese propaganda. From From, a finalist for the 2023 National Book Award for Poetry, is a complex critique of how race is handled in the United States that challenges readers to change not only how they think about racism, but how they speak about it, too. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: From From on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/From.jpg?quality=85&w=800,History
The Future,by Naomi Alderman,"Naomi Alderman, author of the 2016 phenomenon The Power, returns with a thrilling, apocalyptic novel. In The Future, the world is ending, and the tech billionaires who played a major role in its destruction are forewarned, giving them the opportunity to escape to a bunker to save themselves while the rest of humanity perishes. But even the richest people on the planet are not immune to certain forces. In a novel that jumps through time and between perspectives, Alderman draws out the stories of the haves and the have-nots to show how the world has become what it is. The result is a nerve-wracking and sometimes hilarious narrative that raises urgent questions about technology, capitalism, and power. —Mahita Gajanan Buy Now: The Future on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TheFuture.jpg?quality=85&w=800,History
Ghost Music,by An Yu,"Song Yan is starting to realize that she made the wrong choice when she abandoned her training as a concert pianist to marry her milquetoast husband, Bowen. His disinterest in having children and the arrival of his unfriendly mother, whom Song Yan is often left to care for while Bowen travels for work, have made their home a lonely place. This conventional enough domestic malaise fuels the sophomore novel by Braised Pork author An Yu. Then things take a turn for the surreal as mushrooms—edible, poison, possibly psychedelic—disrupt both Song Yan’s waking and dream lives. Reality and hallucinations blur, sending her on a journey to confront the apparition of her squandered talent. Trippy as Ghost Music can be, Yu’s spare prose grounds the spectral story in the recognizable psyche of a young woman yearning to start over. —Judy Berman Buy Now: Ghost Music on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GhostMusic.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Fiction
The Good Life,by Robert Waldinger and Marc Schulz,"What does it take to live a truly good life? Money, success, great love? Robert Waldinger and Marc Schulz, the current director and associate director of the Harvard Study of Adult Development, attempt to answer this age-old question in their New York Times best seller The Good Life: Lessons from the World’s Longest Scientific Study of Happiness. The book is the result of the “longest in‑depth longitudinal study of human life ever done.” Launched in 1938, the study—which is still ongoing—traces the lives of 724 participants and more than 1,300 of their descendants. Its takeaway thus far, unpacked in The Good Life, should come as no surprise: that deep, healthy relationships keep us happier. Waldinger and Schulz’s industrious use of research and data, as well as their thoughtful and relatable storytelling, serve as a welcome alternative to traditional self-help fare and a heartwarming guide for those of us plagued by the chaos of modern living. —Rachel Sonis Buy Now: The Good Life on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TheGoodLife.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography
The Great Reclamation,by Rachel Heng,"In many ways, Rachel Heng’s spellbinding novel The Great Reclamation is as much a sweeping coming-of-age story as it is an exhaustive history of 20th-century Singapore. The book—cleverly titled after Singapore’s 1966 post-independence program that added 1,525 hectares of land to its southeastern coast—begins with the journey of 7-year-old Ah Boon. A misfit among his fisherman family, Ah Boon goes on a fishing trip one night with his father and older brother off the coast of their village. There, he discovers a group of small islands that seem to not only appear with the moon, but also bring with them a bounty of fish. As Ah Boon grows up, he inevitably begins to confront the changing world around him. He meets great loves, suffers incredible losses, and above all, wrestles with the cost of modernization, as local government officials push for a land reclamation project where he grew up. Heng uses Ah Boon’s arc to tell the story of Singapore through its many shifts—from Japanese occupation to British colonial rule to its independence and stratospheric prosperity. Told with a critical eye, nuance, and heart, The Great Reclamation is a moving look at what human innovation looks like, and the price we all have to pay for it. —Rachel Sonis Buy Now: The Great Reclamation on Bookshop | Amazon Looking for more book recommendations?

The Great White Bard,by Farah Karim-Cooper,"No, cancel culture has not come for William Shakespeare. The Great White Bard is not a takedown of Shakespeare’s most famous works, but instead a near-forensic audit of his plays through a racial lens. “To love Shakespeare means to know him,” Farah Karim-Cooper writes. Instead of “worshiping his words,” she believes that interrogating them “allows us to confront crucial questions of our day.” Through rigid and nuanced analysis, the co-director of education at Shakespeare’s Globe theater and noted Shakespeare scholar argues that the bard helped shape the Elizabethan and Renaissance ideals of race, but not for the better. As she finds examples of racial prejudice, misogynoir, and anti-semitism in Shakespeare’s plays, she hopes that readers can recognize his flaws as a way to afford themselves a deeper understanding of his work. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: The Great White Bard on Bookshop CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TheGreatWhiteBard.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Other
Greek Lessons,by Han Kang,"Han Kang, winner of the 2016 Man Booker International Prize for The Vegetarian, is known for her ability to lay bare the lives of complicated women. Her latest novel, Greek Lessons, first released in 2011 and newly translated into English by Deborah Smith and Emily Yae Won, focuses on a South Korean mother who loses the ability to speak after her own mother dies and she loses custody of her son. To explore the possibilities of language beyond her native Korean, and in the hopes of recovering her voice, the unnamed woman takes a course in ancient Greek where she meets a professor who suffers from a degenerative eye disease that will eventually cause him to go blind. The two bond over their respective disabilities; not through words, but instead through sly glances and inadvertent touch. In absorbing prose, Kang allows these two lonely people to communicate their deepest fears and regrets in an attempt to find a way forward.

In The Half Known Life: In Search of Paradise, Iyer travels the globe—from Iran to Kashmir to Japan to Northern Ireland—to demystify how different communities perceive eternal happiness, and how their quest to achieve it manifests in the face of political, social, and environmental instability. The result is a lyrical, if paradoxical, meditation on a fervent pursuit for happiness that often feels out of reach. Iyer asks himself: Can paradise exist? Is this the place?

The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store,by James McBride,"In National Book Award-winning author James McBride’s new novel, there aren’t any skeletons in the closet, but there is one buried in a well. The book’s central mystery begins in 1972 with the discovery of human remains in Pottstown, Pa. The only physical evidence found at the decades-old scene are a belt buckle, a pendant, and a mezuzah, a scroll of parchment paper inscribed with verses from the Torah that is affixed to the doorposts of Jewish homes. The latter leads authorities to speak with the only Jewish man who still remains in Chicken Hill, the town’s once-bustling Black and Jewish neighborhood. To understand the present, McBride takes us back to the past, the 1920s and ’30s, when the diverse but divided neighborhood came together to protect an orphaned Black child from being institutionalized. McBride’s rich cast of characters feel so realized that it is hard not to root for these neighbors who find themselves at a crossroads. When the members of the community are once again asked to put their cultural differences aside to help in the investigation of the case, The Heaven & Earth Grocery proves that a common enemy can be a uniting force. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store on Bookshop | Amazon Looking for more book recommendations?

Hello Beautiful,by Ann Napolitano,"Ann Napolitano is perhaps best known for Dear Edward, a best seller but the sort of tearjerker that might scare away some readers. And while there are tragic aspects to her new novel—the book begins “For the first six days of William Waters’s life, he was not an only child,” presaging a loss that will define the character’s life—the tender narrative is at its best when it’s exploring the strength of familial bonds. William, shunned by grieving parents, finds salvation in basketball and particularly the structure of a team. He falls in with another family when he becomes romantically entangled with Julia and, by extension, her three sisters. The four girls bicker about which March sibling each would be in Little Women. Hello Beautiful achieves a similar alchemy to that classic novel as it builds up those sisterly relationships and then pushes them to the brink while simultaneously weaving in William’s own compelling story of growth. —Eliana Dockterman Buy Now: Hello Beautiful on Bookshop | Amazon Looking for more book recommendations?

Holding Pattern,By Jenny Xie,"After Kathleen Cheng is dumped by her boyfriend, she takes a job as a professional cuddler at a Bay Area startup. But what starts as an ironic attempt to fill her time while stuck in her hometown for her mother’s wedding soon becomes a profound lesson in intimacy. After Kathleen takes the job, each chapter of Jenny Xie’s absorbing debut novel begins with a set of instructions on how to properly perform its techniques, from the “cuddle puddle” to the “half spoon.” It would be easy to laugh at the notion that one needs a lesson in how to hold someone. Yet Xie writes with such tenderness that it is nearly impossible not to feel moved by the profound effect this forced closeness has on the stubborn Kathleen. By opening herself up to the touch of strangers, Kathleen becomes more receptive to an embrace from her mother, a livewire who acts as her daughter’s greatest foil.

How to Say Babylon,By Safiya Sinclair,"Poet Safiya Sinclair grew up in a militant Rastafarian household in Jamaica under the watchful eye of her father, who she describes as having been domineering and insistent on purity above all else. Sinclair writes that her father feared that “Babylon,” the Rasta term for Western society, would corrupt his daughters. Her debut memoir, How to Say Babylon, is a reflective and compassionate recounting of how she broke away from her father and his beliefs to become her own person. A published poet at 16, writing was Sinclair’s salvation from the pressure her father, a talented but struggling musician, put on her to be the perfect Rasta daughter. “I was too headstrong, too curious,” she writes. “Too much of myself, and not enough of him.” It is only by excavating her own past, her own need for rebellion, that Sinclair begins to understand her father’s embrace of a religious and political movement that has long been a persecuted minority in her home country. In songlike prose, she describes how they were both looking for liberation, and how she believes only one of them has found it. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: How to Say Babylon on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/HowToSayBabylon.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography

After years of living in New York, Iduma returns to Nigeria in 2020 to investigate the disappearance of his namesake uncle, who went missing while fighting in the war. A thorough and thoughtful reporter, Iduma explains how it has become taboo in Nigerian culture to discuss the war, and uses his family’s own tragedy to tell the devastating story of a country that has not been allowed to properly mourn its dead.

Though his jealousy and casual cruelty causes her pain, she fights back her tears, always waiting to cry until they’re no longer together. “Cries as she vacuums, cries as she cleans the kitchen, cries in the bathroom as she scrubs the shower and sink,” Erpenbeck writes of Katharina’s hidden waterworks, one of many warnings of the major heartbreak to come. But Erpenbeck’s hypnotic prose and brilliant accounting of German history make the impending breakup feel particularly profound.

Liliana’s Invincible Summer,by Cristina Rivera Garza,"In the summer of 1990, Cristina Rivera Garza’s sister Liliana was murdered in her native Mexico. An arrest warrant was filed for her ex-boyfriend, but he disappeared during the investigation. Twenty-nine years after Liliana’s death, in 2019, Rivera Garza travels back on a mission to find her sister’s missing case file—and the suspect who fled. In her genre-defying memoir, she paints a portrait of her sister as an architecture student, a cinephile, an activist, and a swimmer. And she retraces her sister’s footsteps in her final days, interweaving excerpts from Liliana’s journals and evidence from the case, including letters and blueprints, in her quest for the truth. Instead of asking how a woman like Liliana could end up in an abusive situation, Rivera Garza probes why women bear the responsibility for male violence and sheds light on femicide, the murder of a woman because of her gender, calling for the end of oppressive, Byzantine systems that keep killers free and women in danger. —Meg Zukin Buy Now: Liliana’s Invincible Summer on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/LilianasInvincibleSummer.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography

The Male Gazed,By Manuel Betancourt,"With The Male Gazed: On Hunks, Heartthrobs, and What Pop Culture Taught Me About (Desiring) Men, queer writer and film critic Manuel Betancourt fuses memoir and cultural criticism to deconstruct the myth of conventional masculinity. Growing up in Bogotá, Colombia, Betancourt didn’t think he was “man enough” by society’s standards. He was obsessed with telenovela stars, Disney princes, and Ricky Martin, and often found himself asking: “Do I want him or do I want to be him?” In this delightful collection of personal essays, he explores portrayals of masculinity to rethink what it means to be a man. In “Wrestling Heartthrobs,” he uses his infatuation with Mario Lopez’s unitard-wearing Saved By the Bell character A.C. Slater to grapple with his attraction to the high-school jock archetype. What Betancourt discovers through the witty and probing analysis of his own desires is that masculinity is a concept that has always been too inflexible for its own good.

Master Slave Husband Wife,by Ilyon Woo,"Ilyon Woo’s follow-up to her 2010 book The Great Divorce, which focused on an infamous 19th century break up, is a vivid retelling of enslaved couple Ellen and William Craft’s harrowing journey from Georgia to Philadelphia in 1848 to gain back their freedom. Ellen, who was born enslaved to a white farmer, pretended to be a white man traveling up north for medical care. To fool fellow travelers, she donned a clever disguise—a silk stovepipe hat, dark green glasses, a sling for her right arm, and bandages wrapped around her face to hide her feminine features—and cast her husband, William, an enslaved cabinetmaker, as her dutiful servant. Woo describes their escape in exquisite detail and reveals their fascinating connection to the Civil War and the abolition of slavery. It’s an edge-of-your-seat drama that will leave many wondering why the duo’s remarkable story has been so overlooked by history. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Master Slave Husband Wife on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MasterSlaveHusbandWife.jpg?quality=85&w=800,History
Mobility,by Lydia Kiesling,"Through the lens of one American woman’s life, acclaimed author Lydia Kiesling shines a light on how individual complicity in capitalism has helped fuel the global environmental crisis. Beginning in 1998 and stretching across decades, Mobility follows protagonist Bunny Glenn as she navigates politics, relationships, and the banality of corporate greed, from her teenage years living in Azerbaijan with her family through her rise in the oil industry to what Kiesling refers to as a “doom-filled futurecast.” This incisive and often funny coming-of-age novel is a profound standout among the growing shelf of literature addressing climate change. —Megan McCluskey Buy Now: Mobility on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mobility.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography
Mott Street,by Ava Chin,"Growing up in Queens as the only child of a single mother, author and professor Ava Chin never really knew her origins. In her deeply researched memoir, Mott Street: A Chinese American Family’s Story of Exclusion and Homecoming, she traces her family’s history from the Pearl River Delta in southern China to the titular New York City street in the heart of Chinatown where her relatives would put down permanent roots. Chin delights in recalling the lives of her more colorful ancestors, like Chin On, her hard-drinking, hatchet-carrying paternal great-grandfather. But she also writes unflinchingly of the racism and marginalization her family faced after arriving in the American West in the mid-19th century. In painstaking detail, she breaks down the effects the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which blocked Chinese immigrants from citizenship for six decades, has had on generations of families who still face discrimination today. Mott Street is a sensitively told story of survival, resilience, and resistance. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Mott Street on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MottStreet.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography
My Name Is Barbra,by Barbra Streisand,"At nearly 1,000 pages, the long-anticipated memoir from Barbra Streisand covers her more than 60-year career, and she bares plenty. It’s all in there: stories about her childhood and relationship with her mother, landing her first Broadway audition, doing Funny Girl, and even the media attention directed toward her nose. In reflecting on those moments and more, Streisand reveals she has always been exactly who she is: confident, maybe a little brazen, and one of the best performers who has ever lived. —Mahita Gajanan Buy Now: My Name Is Barbra on Bookshop | Amazon Looking for more book recommendations?

None of the Above,by Travis Alabanza,"In None of the Above: Reflections on Life Beyond the Binary, Travis Alabanza unpacks a series of seven phrases people have said to them throughout their life, like, about their gender identity, “So when did you know?” Alabanza dives deep into their lived experience as a Black, mixed-race, working class, nonbinary trans person in a society where visibility doesn’t guarantee safety. Their memoir is a reflection on the gender binary—and how it’s upheld—as well as a vision of a life beyond it. Alabanza asserts that they are not trans because they were born different; “I am trans because the world made me so,” they write. In None of the Above, the author challenges the status quo with searing social commentary peppered with personal anecdotes, even exploring their own uncertainty regarding their gender identity. By being radically honest about their doubt, they challenge the very idea of the gender binary—and how its rigidity impacts those who exist outside of it. —Meg Zukin Buy Now: None of the Above on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NoneOfTheAbove.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography
North Woods,by Daniel Mason,"In his evocative novel North Woods, Daniel Mason traverses three centuries’ worth of lovers, families, friends, foes, and ghosts on a lush plot of land in the woods of New England. North Woods begins with a pair of Puritan runaway lovers who leave their homes and families to begin a new life of freedom together. As time passes, new characters come to live in the home that the couple built, including a young Black mother fleeing slavery, a contemporary postdoctoral fellow seeking respite in nature, and an artist pining for a forbidden love, among others. Weaving between multiple eras, the book is a deft study in the universal feelings of longing and a desire for escape. —Cady Lang Buy Now: North Woods on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NorthWoods.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography
Nothing Special,by Nicole Flattery,"In Nicole Flattery’s Nothing Special, Mae revisits her youth in 1960s New York, where she falls into a typist job at Andy Warhol’s Factory. There, she’s tasked with transcribing recordings of Andy’s interviews and grows increasingly fixated on the conversations she hears. But in Flattery’s nostalgic coming-of-age narrative, Warhol is hardly mentioned by name and his Factory is stripped of its infamous mythology, making the observant—and sometimes obsessive—Mae the true star of the story. Though primarily set in 1966, Nothing Special flips back and forth between the past and present, and serves as a clever critique of modern-day parasocial relationships, surveillance, voyeurism, and performance. —Meg Zukin Buy Now: Nothing Special on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/NothingSpecial.jpg?quality=85&w=800,History

Our Share of Night,by Mariana Enriquez,"Argentinian author and journalist Mariana Enriquez returns with a surreal horror epic about the Order, a fictional international cult of wealthy followers focused on attaining the one thing money still can’t buy: immortality. Our Share of Night, first published in Spanish in 2019 and newly translated by Megan McDowell, follows the coming of age of Gaspar, a young man with supernatural skills whose mother is a descendent of one of the Order’s founding families. After she dies mysteriously, Gaspar is left under the care of his grief-stricken and abusive father, Juan, a powerful medium who believes the cult is out to exploit his son’s gifts. Gaspar, however, worries that his inherited clairvoyance is actually a curse against humanity. Set in the years before and after Argentina’s “Dirty War,” in which an estimated tens of thousands of people were killed or disappeared under the country’s military dictatorship between 1974 and 1983, the 600-page book doesn’t shy away from the gory details of tyranny. Using her country’s violent past as inspiration, Enriquez spins a terrifying tale of privilege, exploitation, and complicity that acts as a warning for the future. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Our Share of Night on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OurShareOfNight.jpg?quality=85&w=800,History
Owner of a Lonely Heart,by Beth Nguyen,"In her powerful second memoir, Owner of a Lonely Heart, Beth Nguyen writes of the isolation she felt while growing up as a Vietnamese refugee in a mostly white town in Michigan. In 1975, when she was just a baby, Nguyen’s family fled Saigon the day before the Vietnam War ended, but her mother chose to stay behind. “Or was left behind in Saigon,” Nguyen writes. “For many years, I wouldn’t know which phrasing was more true.” Nguyen was 10 when her mother immigrated to Boston, but, over the course of her adult life, the author has spent less than 24 hours with her. After giving birth to a second child of her own, she felt she needed to know the truth about what had happened all those years ago, and to understand the woman whose absence had defined her life. Nguyen uses her fleeting, often heartbreaking encounters with her mother to ruminate on memory, parenthood, and what it means to truly care for someone. Through considering the other maternal figures in her life—her grandmother and her stepmother, who she refers to as her “real mom”—she finds compassion for the woman who gave birth to her. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Owner of a Lonely Heart on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/OwnerOfALonelyHeart.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography
Pageboy,by Elliot Page,"Elliot Page’s buzzy memoir is a brutally honest story of survival. He tells his story of embracing his trans identity through a series of non-linear vignettes, jumping back and forth through time— mirroring the disorientation he experienced discovering his true self on and off sets. In Pageboy, the actor pieces together childhood flashbacks, haunting memories of Hollywood policing his queerness, visceral meditations on gender dysphoria, and ecstatic recollections of gender euphoria. Page, who was the first openly trans man to appear on the cover of TIME, uses the privilege he has as a Hollywood star to share his experiences and advocate for his community in an era of record-high anti-LGBTQ legislation. Page dedicates the book “to all those who came before,” and asks his readers to simply let him—and other trans folks—exist, “happier than ever.” —Meg Zukin Buy Now: Pageboy on Bookshop | Amazon Looking for more book recommendations?

Pineapple Street,by Jenny Jackson,"In life, we have pop stars and mega-influencers. On TV, the Roys of Succession and vacationers on The White Lotus. And in book editor Jenny Jackson’s fizzy debut novel, there are the Stocktons. These are the uber-wealthy elites whose lavish homes, extravagant dinners, and enviable wardrobes we masses love to ogle. In Pineapple Street, Jackson conjures a family with deep roots in Brooklyn real estate and the kind of money that’s supposed to be able to buy happiness. Cord, Darley, and Georgiana are the privileged Stockton siblings who, though well-mannered, are often lacking in the self-awareness department, particularly when it comes to their treatment (or in Georgiana’s case, choice) of their romantic partners. Chip and Tilda are the parents struggling through the transition to the back seat. And on the fringes of it all is Sasha, Cord’s wife and, as a middle-class Rhode Islander who Darley and Georgiana refer to as “the gold digger,” the black sheep. It’s the three women who create the core narrative of Jackson’s novel as they navigate their relationships with men and each other, and learn what it truly means to be a family. —Lucy Feldman Buy Now: Pineapple Street on Bookshop | Amazon Looking for more book recommendations?

The stories of those people, who they were, their lives and their deaths, are at the center of this moving and powerfully original book. Based on the author’s own family’s experiences as Jews in France during World War II, the novel is devoted to the principle that to restore their lives, down to the everyday details, is to honor their memory.

"Poverty, by America",by Matthew Desmond,"Why is there so much poverty in the richest nation in the world? That’s the question acclaimed sociologist Matthew Desmond sets out to answer with Poverty, by America. The topic is a familiar one for the author, whose 2016 book, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City, examined the role poverty plays in America’s housing crisis. Here, Desmond expands his purview and discovers that wealthy and middle class Americans are complicit, both intentionally and unintentionally, in a broken system that exploits the poor. Desmond argues that there must be a radical overhaul of U.S. policies on poverty, which are simply not working. “No state had a child poverty rate higher than Mississippi’s, at roughly 28%,” he writes, “which is also the child poverty rate of Costa Rica.” What Desmond’s book so deftly shows is that poverty is not a personal failure. It’s the result of a society willing to turn a blind eye to its own inequities. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Poverty, by America on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PovertyByAmerica.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Other

They both have dreams of a better life, one outside the city of Cork. Rachel spends her days in class, enduring a schoolgirl crush on her professor Fred; but he has his eye on someone else—Rachel’s roommate. While James and Fred’s affair takes off, Rachel cycles through bad boyfriends, and Ireland’s economy plummets in the background.

She’s married, pregnant, and toiling away on a story when she learns that Fred is in a coma. Caroline O’Donoghue’s second novel flips between the past and present as Rachel is catapulted back in time to her college flat. The Rachel Incident encompasses what it means to be a very specific age during a very specific era in a very specific place.

Relying on heartbreaking personal accounts from those who lived in the country during the 1960s and ’70s, the text is an excavation of the radical ideology that led to a movement defined by political and social chaos and violence. In writing this, Branigan bears witness to one of the darkest and most formative moments in Chinese history—a period defined by the massacre of many, the destruction of art and culture, and an air of fear that shaped the country as we know it today. —Cady Lang Buy Now: Red Memory on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RedMemory.jpg?quality=85&w=800,History
Ripe,by Sarah Rose Etter,"Burnt out from spending her days at a soul-crushing Silicon Valley start-up, Cassie spends her nights staring into the void—and dealing with the literal black hole that has been her constant companion since she was a little girl. In Sarah Rose Etter’s surreal follow-up to her 2019 debut, The Book of X, Cassie’s black hole becomes an apt metaphor for depression, growing to the size of a melon or becoming big enough to block out the sun depending on the state of her angst. Etter’s prose is so visceral it’s hard not to get caught up in Cassie’s infinite sadness. After discovering that she is pregnant, Cassie begins to wonder what it would be like to jump into the hole. Would it tear her apart or send her to some alternate dimension where she would finally be happy? Etter wrote Ripe after the death of her father, when she felt a cloud of grief following her around. Like the author, Cassie’s black hole becomes a necessary evil; she must embrace the darkness in order to find the light. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Ripe on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ripe.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Other

So she runs, fleeing the threat of a life of indentured servitude in search of the five children who were taken from her and sold. As Rachel undertakes a brutal journey from Barbados into the forests of British Guiana and across the sea to Trinidad, River Sing Me Home weaves together a historical accounting of the perils of British emancipation with a moving interrogation of what freedom really means. —Megan McCluskey Buy Now: River Sing Me Home on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RiverSingMeHome.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography

Spare,by Prince Harry,"The titillating details threaten to overshadow the lyrical prose in Prince Harry’s buzzy memoir, which made countless headlines when it was published in January. But Spare is the rare tell-all that finds balance. Sure, the book features an insider’s perspective on wedding-related squabbles between Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton, a moment when Prince William physically attacks Harry, and an anecdote about Harry’s frostbitten penis. But the talented ghostwriter J.R. Moehringer (who has pulled off this trick before in Andre Agassi’s memoir Open and Phil Knight’s Shoedog) finds literary heft in Harry’s life in a gilded cage. Never before has a celebrity memoir pulled off comparisons between its subject and another dithering prince: Hamlet. Even the story of Harry’s icy appendage segues into a moment of reflection on how the press scrutinized every intimate detail of his life since he was a child—including whether he had been circumcised.

The Talk,by Darrin Bell,"The Talk is a masterfully crafted graphic memoir that follows the throughline of the titular talk: the conversation that parents have with their Black children about how the world—and particularly the police—view them differently.

He asked her why his water gun was bright green, rather than a realistic black like everyone else’s, and she explained that she feared for his safety.

Now, 42 years after that conversation with his mother, Bell—who in 2019 became the first Black cartoonist to win a Pulitzer Prize—is a father of four. In his moving book, he grapples with whether and when to have the talk with his son Zazu. It was in 2020, when Zazu was 6 years old, that the boy asked, “Who’s George Floyd?” And Bell realized that the right time to have the talk is whenever your child asks. —Laura Zornosa Buy Now: The Talk on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TheTalk.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography

Thin Skin,By Jenn Shapland,"It is rarely a compliment to be called “thin-skinned,” but essayist Jenn Shapland wears it like a badge of honor. “To be thin-skinned is to feel keenly,” she writes in the collection’s titular opening piece. “To perceive things that might go unseen, unnoticed, that others might prefer not to notice.” Shapland is an expert on the topic—she was diagnosed with extreme dermatologic sensitivity—and writes of her sensitivities across five sweeping essays, which interrogate everything from her relationship with food to the anxiety she feels in a crowd. The author of My Autobiography of Carson McCullers then unspools how these vulnerabilities affect the way she interacts with the outside world. In “The Toomuchness,” she uses an infestation of cloth-eating moths to untangle America’s culture of excess and how it attacks our sense of self. (“They made me buy stuff for my stuff,” she writes, “and I already have too much.”) Thin Skin could have been Shapland’s argument for why we should protect our sensitive epidermises from the harshness of the world. Instead, she encourages us to break down our emotional, mental, and physical barriers and really explore what life’s got to offer, even if it may hurt a little. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Thin Skin on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ThinSkin.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography

Thunderclap,By Laura Cumming,"British art critic Laura Cumming believes that her life can be summed up through the great works of the 17th-century Dutch painters she grew up loving. In her genre-defying memoir, she uses the artwork of Vermeer and Rembrandt, among others, to explore love, loss, and loneliness. The book’s title refers to the accidental explosion of a gunpowder arsenal in 1654 Delft, which killed 1,200 people and all but wiped out the Dutch city. The explosion’s most notable victim was Carel Fabritius, the gifted young painter of “The Goldfinch,” which was the inspiration for Donna Tartt’s 2013 novel of the same name. The book is a eulogy for the painter who suddenly lost his life at the age of 32, but also for the author’s father, renowned Scottish painter James Cumming, whose death at 68 came too soon. “Paintings are not substitutes,” Cumming’s dad told her. “They are something else altogether.” To Cumming, that something else is a way to keep those she loves alive long after they are gone. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Thunderclap on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Thunderclap.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography

Tremor,by Teju Cole,"Early in the writer, critic, and photographer Teju Cole’s first novel in 12 years, Tunde, a Harvard professor of Nigerian descent, receives word that a colleague he barely knew has died. The news, delivered by the university’s dean rather dispassionately, leads Tunde on a quest to understand what it truly means to be alive. Written during the COVID-19 pandemic, Tremor is an ambitious meditation on the type of interruption that can steer a life off course, whether it be a death, a struggling marriage, or a surprising artifact found during a weekend of antiquing. Cole’s unconventional second novel meanders in provocative ways, often forgoing plot to follow its protagonist as he reflects on a violent world and his place in it. The book is hypnotic, offering a vulnerable look at personal identity and privilege, as well as a wide-angle view on art and American history. The unexpected loss of life is also a prevailing theme. Throughout the novel, Tunde addresses a close friend who recently died, referred to only as “You,” in the hopes of accepting his own mortality. Yet Tremor isn’t mournful. Instead, it’s a sobering reminder that an unexamined life is not worth living. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Tremor on Bookshop | Amazon Looking for more book recommendations?

The Vaster Wilds,by Lauren Groff,"Over the past 15 years, Lauren Groff has written about a dead lake monster, a 12th-century mystic, a utopian commune, and more. Now, with her fifth novel, the three-time finalist for the National Book Award is focused on a servant girl in the early 17th century who finds herself lost in the wild. In the dead of night, and the dead of winter, “the girl,” as she is known, escapes a colonial settlement in Virginia. While she has been warned of the monsters, both real and imagined, that live outside the colony’s walls, she faces more immediate threats from within them. Desperate to live, the girl goes to great lengths—roasting baby squirrels, stealing the boots of a dead man—to survive on her own. What The Vaster Wilds makes clear is that even in an inhospitable world, no one is ever truly alone. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: The Vaster Wilds on Bookshop | Amazon Looking for more book recommendations?

The Vegan,by Andrew Lipstein,"Andrew Lipstein’s second novel is at once bracingly contemporary and deeply strange. Poised at the intersection of tech, finance, ethics, and a natural world in crisis, it follows a hedge fund manager named Herschel Caine who is about to render the rest of Wall Street obsolete thanks to an infallible algorithm. The plan goes awry in the horrifying aftermath of a small act of interpersonal sabotage on Herschel’s part, causing our narrator to compulsively purify himself through overidentification with animals, late-night rambles to the zoo, and, yes, the adoption of a vegan lifestyle that wreaks havoc on his power lunches. Propelled by Herschel’s American Psycho meets moral philosophy internal monologue—and a biting sense of humor—The Vegan channels the queasy paranoia of an era when the fear of human extinction via machine learning can make even masters of the universe feel like trapped animals. —Judy Berman Buy Now: The Vegan on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TheVegan.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography
Vengeance Is Mine,by Marie NDiaye,"Maître Susane is a 42-year-old lawyer in Bordeaux, France. She’s diligent and highly skilled, but her work is quite ordinary, so she’s confused when a man named Gilles Principaux asks her to defend his wife, Marlyne, who has been accused of murdering their children. But it’s more than the unusual request or the macabre nature of the crime that bothers her: Gilles seems strangely familiar to Maître Susane, but she can’t quite put her finger on why. The refrain “Who, to her, was Gilles Principaux?” echoes throughout Marie NDiaye’s thrilling novel as Maître Susane begins to fray—and her quest to understand the significance of this quasi-stranger threatens to upend her relationships with the people closest to her. Vengeance Is Mine, translated by Jordan Stump, interrogates how and what we remember, class and racial anxiety, and the meaning of justice. —Laura Zornosa Buy Now: Vengeance Is Mine on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/VengenceIsMine.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Fiction
Victory City,by Salman Rushdie,"Salman Rushdie’s Victory City is an astounding work of historical fiction and magical realism. As the lowly, unnamed narrator explains in the book’s opening pages, this is an abridged version of an epic 24,000-verse poem originally written in Sanskrit. Rushdie’s novel, written before the brutal 2022 stabbing attack that left him blind in one eye and unable to use one of his hands, describes the rise and fall of an empire through the 247-year lifespan of blind poet and prophet Pampa Kampana. At 9 years old, after witnessing the death of her mother, Pampa is possessed by a goddess who gives her the power to create a great city called Bisnaga, which Rushdie based on Vijayanagar, the medieval empire founded in 1336 South India. Pampa is able to mold the magical kingdom, soon nicknamed “Victory City,” into the feminist utopia the goddess hoped it would be, only to watch it be brought down by the hubris of the men who would come into power a century later. With wonder and humor, Rushdie spins a decades-long tale about power, philosophy, justice, and exile that boldly confronts the issues modern societies still face. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Victory City on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/VictoryCity.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography
The Wager,by David Grann,"David Grann, the best-selling author of Killers of the Flower Moon and The Lost City of Z, returns with another historical epic about a mystery nearly lost to time. The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder recounts the thrilling true story of the HMS Wager, a sixth-rate Royal Navy ship, and a mutiny that may or may not have taken place. It’s not an easy story to tell, as Grann freely admits in his opening author’s note, being that “the participants’ conflicting, and at times warring, perspectives” were all he had to go by. What we know for sure: in January 1742, a deteriorated boat washed up on the shores of Brazil with 30 men who claimed they were the survivors of the shipwrecked Wager—and yet six months later another vessel landed in Chile with three men who swore that those castaways were actually mutineers. Using the crew’s log books, daily journals, and court testimony, Grann paints a gruesome portrait of the danger and uncertainty that came with being a sailor in the 18th century. In 1740, 250 men set sail from England on a secret mission. The threat of war was all around, but so was the fear of dying at sea of scurvy, typhus, or delirium. (Grann describes, in gory detail, a table used aboard the warship to amputate rotting limbs without anesthesia.) Once the crew is marooned on an island off the coast of Chilean Patagonia, he writes in stunning detail about the ghastly lengths they went to to survive, with some turning to cannibalism to fend off starvation. He describes how the men were saved by the island’s indigenous people—Kawésqar and the Chono—but, because of their imperialist upbringing, couldn’t help but refer to their saviors as “savages.” In Grann’s capable hands, The Wager is not just a suspenseful mystery at sea, it’s also a page-turning tragic farce in which there may be no heroes and villains, just mortal men suffering from delusions of grandeur. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: The Wager on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/TheWager.jpg?quality=85&w=800,History
Waiting to Be Arrested at Night,by Tahir Hamut Izgil,"Poet Tahir Hamut Izgil’s memoir, Waiting to Be Arrested at Night: A Uyghur Poet’s Memoir of China’s Genocide, offers a personal and moving look at the persecution of the Uyghur people by the Chinese government beginning in the mid-’90s. Izgil lays out what it was like to live in the country and the clues the rest of the world missed, or chose to ignore, of the horrors to come—the Council on Foreign Relations and more have reported that more than a million Uyghurs have been imprisoned over the last decade. Izgil resists detailing the violence he and his people have faced, but his restraint makes the descriptions of the police’s constant harassment and surveillance feel all the more Orwellian. He shares the story of his own first run-in with the Chinese police, which happened in 1996 when he attempted to travel to Turkey to study and was accused of stealing state secrets. He was tortured and sent to prison for a year and a half, before being sentenced to a “re-education through labor” camp for three years. But it wasn’t until 2017, when the police began the mass internment of the Uyghurs, that Izgil knew he and his family had to flee. In absorbing prose, translated by Joshua L. Freeman, Izgil recounts the process of finding a way out. He considers himself to be one of the lucky ones, and he writes with sorrow for those he left behind. Waiting to Be Arrested at Night is a harrowing story of personal resilience and an exposé on an urgent humanitarian crisis. —Shannon Carlin Buy Now: Waiting to Be Arrested at Night on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/WaitingtoBeArrestedAtNight.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography
Wandering Souls,by Cecile Pin,"Anh is just 16 when she loses everything. At the end of the Vietnam War, Anh and her younger brothers Thanh and Minh are sent on a boat to a refugee camp in Hong Kong, their sights set on a new life in the U.S. The arrangement is meant to be temporary—the trio’s parents and their younger siblings are supposed to join them soon after—but time stretches on as Anh and her brothers await their arrival. Eventually, they learn the devastating truth: their family didn’t survive the journey, leaving Anh, Thanh, and Minh alone in a land where they have nothing and no one. Cecile Pin’s transporting debut novel is impressively compact, telling a multigenerational—and at times mystical—story of duty, grief, and legacy in just 240 swift and moving pages. —Lucy Feldman Buy Now: Wandering Souls on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/wanderingSouls.jpg?quality=85&w=800,Biography

When Crack Was King,by Donovan X. Ramsey,"In When Crack Was King: A People’s History of a Misunderstood Era, veteran journalist Donovan X. Ramsey shrewdly disrupts a harmful narrative surrounding the crack epidemic of the 1980s and ’90s. The book—which was longlisted for a 2023 National Book Award—is poignant and emotional, following four individuals who were harmed by the epidemic and telling those stories alongside the author’s own experiences growing up in that same time period in Columbus, Ohio. Ramsey parses how the media and the global campaign launched by the U.S. government, known as “the war on drugs,” only exacerbated the issue, in particular, for the Black community. A compassionate and urgent story that centers the victims of this superdrug, When Crack Was King is an illuminating look at the devastating, racialized impacts of the U.S. criminal justice system—and a warning for us to do better as more drug epidemics rear their ugly heads. —Rachel Sonis Buy Now: When Crack Was King on Bookshop | Amazon CONTACT US AT LETTERS@TIME.COM.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/WhenCrackWasKing.jpg?quality=85&w=800,History

Yellowface,by R.F. Kuang,"All June Hayward has ever wanted is to be a literary prodigy like her friend Athena Liu. Both studied creative writing at Yale and both have joined the ranks of published authors. But only Athena has made the best seller lists, won awards, and landed a big TV deal. June’s convinced the industry is rigged in favor of people like Athena—beautiful, “diverse” writers of the moment—and that she’s only missing out on sales and media attention because she’s white and isn’t “cool.” So when Athena dies in a freak choking accident and no one but June sees it happen, June decides it’s only fair that she steal the sole copy of Athena’s latest manuscript. Athena’s book is a heavily researched epic about the Chinese Labor Corps in World War I, and June decides to edit it to her liking and publish it as her own. She’s paid her dues, and it’s her turn to shine, right? In R.F. Kuang’s deliciously uncomfortable thriller, the protagonist adopts the pen name Juniper Song and crosses every boundary in the hopes of building herself in Athena’s prestigious image, all the while misunderstanding the pressures her late friend faced as an Asian woman in the harsh spotlight of the publishing world. —Lucy Feldman Buy Now: Yellowface on Bookshop | Amazon Looking for more book recommendations?
